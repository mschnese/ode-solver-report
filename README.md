# ode-solver-report

## Objective: Compare 6 different ODE solvers (Implicit and Explicit Euler's, 2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta, 4th order Adams-Bashforth, and 4th order Adams-Moulton) based on 2 differential equations. This was my final project for my Numerical Methods class.

## Contents: MATLAB files for each solver and a main file to compare accuracy, Word Document containing technical report
